These variations are often associated with cell-to-cell signalling and response, which are at the basis of communication and computation at the tissue level. Calcium ions (Ca2+) are frequently studied as a messenger, and are also known to play a role in the mechanical properties of cells, which in turn play a role in morphogenesis --- the generation of form.\n\nThe Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM) is the stem cell niche in land plants, from which all above-ground organs originate, namely leaves, flowers and the extension of the stem itself. Using microscopy time-lapse fluorescent imaging, and a fluorescent reporter for Ca2+ concentrations, our research group has identified and characterized three main types of Ca2+ signal patterns in the SAM: (1) single cell spikes, or twinkling (2) spontaneous global tissue oscillations, and (3) an inducible global wave-like propagation of Ca2+ cellular concentration. Studying the temporal variation of Ca2+ at single cell level throughout the tissue would allow us to further understand  these modes of Ca2+ signals, and the role they play in tissue and organismal dynamics.\n\nThe proposed project is of computational nature, primarily image and data analysis. A successful reduction of the time-lapse imaging data to temporal traces of cellular Ca2+ level would allow quantitative:\n\n* comparison of single cell temporal pattern when twinkling, oscillation, and the stimulated wave, as well as exploring the effects of one mode over the statistics of the other; and\n* study cell-cell correlations, potentially identifying spatio-temporal patterns related to cellular and regional states; this may also open the path to causal structure inference.\n\n",

These variations are often associated with cell-to-cell signalling and response, which are at the basis of communication and computation at the tissue level. Calcium ions (Ca2+) are frequently studied as a messenger, and are also known to play a role in the mechanical properties of cells, which in turn play a role in morphogenesis --- the generation of form.\n\nThe Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM) is the stem cell niche in land plants, from which all above-ground organs originate, namely leaves, flowers and the extension of the stem itself. Using microscopy time-lapse fluorescent imaging, and a fluorescent reporter for Ca2+ concentrations, our research group has identified and characterized three main types of Ca2+ signal patterns in the SAM: (1) single cell spikes, or twinkling (2) spontaneous global tissue oscillations, and (3) an inducible global wave-like propagation of Ca2+ cellular concentration. Studying the temporal variation of Ca2+ at single cell level throughout the tissue would allow us to further understand  these modes of Ca2+ signals, and the role they play in tissue and organismal dynamics.\n\nThe proposed project is of computational nature, primarily image and data analysis. A successful reduction of the time-lapse imaging data to temporal traces of cellular Ca2+ level would allow quantitative:\n\n* comparison of single cell temporal pattern when twinkling, oscillation, and the stimulated wave, as well as exploring the effects of one mode over the statistics of the other; and\n* study cell-cell correlations, potentially identifying spatio-temporal patterns related to cellular and regional states; this may also open the path to causal structure inference.\n\n",

Are probabilities subjective or objective? Probabilities are used throughout physics, and a theory of probabilities that is particularly suitable for physics is still under debate.<br>4.

The archiving effort include turning the raw data into the uniform format of .tif without resolution reduction from the originals, and documenting the experimental conditions for each data set in Word and/or Excel including X-ray images, related diagnostic data and experimental conditions.",
